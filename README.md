# Simple Finance Dashboard

A user-friendly finance dashboard built with Streamlit, allowing you to upload CSV transaction files, categorize your expenses, and visualize your spending habits.

## 🚀 Features

- 📤 Upload CSV files containing transactions
- 📂 Automatically or manually categorize expenses
- ✏️ Add and edit categories dynamically
- 📊 View total payments and categorized expenses
- 🥧 Interactive pie chart of spending breakdown
- 💾 Persistent category saving using `categories.json`

## 📁 CSV Format

Your uploaded CSV should follow this format:


Date,Details,Amount,Debit/Credit 01 Jan 2025,Grocery Store,150.00,Debit 02 Jan 2025,Salary,3000.00,Credit


- **Date format**: DD MMM YYYY (e.g., 01 Jan 2025)
- **Amount** can contain commas (e.g., 1,200.50)
- **Debit/Credit** must specify whether it's an expense or income

## 🧠 How Categorization Works

- Transactions are assigned to "Uncategorized" by default.
- You can manually assign categories in the table.
- When you apply changes, the app saves the Details as a keyword under that category.
- On the next upload, any matching transaction will be auto-categorized.
